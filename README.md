This is the source code for [wprb.rocks][https://wprb.rocks], which is a website that allows you to play playlists from WPRB DJs on Spotify.

It consistes of 2 things - frontend and backend.

**Backend**
* Rails in API mode
* GraphQL for the API


**Frontend**
* `create-react-app` with `apollo` to consume API
* A bunch of components to interact with spotify

### Learning goals

For this project, I really want to learn [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) and [Apollo](https://www.apollographql.com/), which I haven't really dug into yet.

I also want to try using a [minimal CSS framework](https://yon.fun/top-10-css-frameworks/). For [12inch.reviews](https://12inch.reviews), I used Tailwind, which was great, but for this project I want to stay as lean as possible.
